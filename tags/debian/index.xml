So I spent some time to fix the problem.
Background OS, HTTP server and Certbot encryption The OS for the server is Debian 10/buster and nginx HTTP server was installed.</description>

deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ stretch main contrib non-free 2. Remove previous installed NVidia drivers if necessary # apt-get remove --purge nvidia* 3.</description>
